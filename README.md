This lab will guide you through the basic steps of creating, managing, and closing an incident in ServiceNow. Follow the steps below to complete the lab in your ServiceNow Developer instance.
1. Set Up Your ServiceNow Developer Instance
Visit ServiceNow Developer Site. (Sign up for a free developer account if you don’t have one.)
Once logged in, request a Personal Developer Instance. This is a free sandbox environment for you to use.
2. Create a New Incident
In your ServiceNow instance, go to Incident > Create New.
Complete the form with the following details:
Caller: Choose an existing user (e.g., "Joe Employee").
Short Description: Type "User unable to access email."
Set it to High or Medium Priority level.
Click Save to create the incident.
3. Simulate Assignment
Open the incident you just created.
Assign it to yourself or a team (e.g., "IT Support").
In the Work Notes section, add the message:
"Assigned to IT Support for troubleshooting."
4. Update the Ticket
In the Work Notes section, add a comment like:
"Contacted user and verified email access issue."
Change the State to In Progress to show the work is actively being done.
5. Resolve the Incident
In the Resolution Information section, add a note:
"Reset user password and verified email access is restored."
Change the State to Resolved to indicate that the issue has been fixed.
6. Review and Close the Ticket
Change the State to Closed to simulate closing the incident.
Ensure all updates, including comments and status changes, are correctly listed in the Activity section.
